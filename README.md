# WebDevStudios Coding Standards

This branch, `disabled` allows you to have a copy of WDS-Coding-Standards installed that is essentially disabled. This way 
your global setup can still be active but it essentially won't do anything.

## Install

```bash
composer require webdevstudios/wds-coding-standards:disabled@dev
```
