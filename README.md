- Sass linting added [#26](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Coding-Standards/pull/26)

This release brings most of WDS up to par with our currently-established coding standards, of which have been missing from our linting thus-far. Props for this release go to [@aubreypwd](http://github.com/aubreypwd), [@gregrickaby](https://github.com/gregrickaby), [@JayWood](https://github.com/JayWood), [@jrfoell](https://github.com/jrfoell), and [@phatsk](https://github.com/phatsk) for all their helpful work!

## 1.0.1

- Changed `WebDevStudios-phpcs` to just `WebDevStudios` for compatibility with namespaces and new sniffs added later [#12](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Coding-Standards/pull/12)
- Inclusion of the `WordPress-Docs` ruleset

Note, this release breaks some things. When you update to this version,
you will need to update your coding standard to `WebDevStudios` vs the old
`WebDevStudios-phpcs` which should no longer work.

## 1.0.0

- Initial ruleset based on WordPress-Extra
